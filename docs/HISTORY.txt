Changes
=======

0.4 (2012-01-17)
----------------

- Echoed the latest changes from ``cromlech.browser`` regarding the
  `ILayout` component. A `ILayout` is now a simple `IRenderer` and
  as such, it does NOT handle any kind of response and is not
  callable.

- Changed the `__call__` method from the `View` component to introduce a
  new step, called `make_response`. This allows us to have more flexibility
  while trying to alter the response object to be returned.
  
  Additionnaly, this allows us to have a single method for querying a
  layout component, for both `View` from this package and `Form` from
  the ``dolmen.forms`` stack.

  This change has a serious impact on the package API. The util function
  `layout_renderer`, used as a factory, has been replaced by another
  function called `make_layout_response`, that queries the `layoutName`
  attribute of the view class, to resolve the layout name or uses an empty
  name instead (if no attr was found this way).


0.3a3 (2012-01-10)
------------------

- Fixed import errors and dependencies

- Query functions now uses `queryMultiAdapter` instead of `getMultiAdapter`.
  You no longer need to catch errors while querying. None is now returned
  if the queried component is missing. Tests have been modified accordingly.


0.3a2 (2012-01-06)
------------------

- Improved the utility methods used to query the view, layout and template.
  Removed the useless fat.


0.3a1 (2012-01-05)
------------------

- Changed the inner flow of the View component. `update` is no longer
  responsible for the instanciation of the response. Everything linked
  to the response handling has been moved in `__call__`.

- Added a handling of the `HTTPRedirection` exceptions from
  ``cromlech.browser``.

- Added utility methods to query a view layout and a view template.


0.2a1 (2011-11-24)
------------------

- Added i18n capabilities using the new package `cromlech.i18n`.


0.1a2 (2011-05-19)
------------------

- Corrected the security grokking that used to protect views on `IRenderer`
  and not `IView`.


0.1a1 (2011-05-10)
------------------

- Fork from `grokcore.view`
- new API
